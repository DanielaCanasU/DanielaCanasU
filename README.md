##  Featured Projects  

- **AI & ML Web App** ‚Äì Developed during Samsung Innovation Campus, integrating backend APIs with AI models.  
-  My undergraduate thesis focuses on the **design and validation of an automated fall detection system** aimed at improving safety and emergency response. The project integrates **embedded systems, mobile applications, and cloud-based data management** to provide a reliable and scalable solution.  

**Key Contributions:**  
- **Embedded Development (ESP32):** Programmed the ESP32 microcontroller to capture and process accelerometer data, applying detection algorithms for abnormal motion patterns.  
- **Mobile Application (Kotlin + Android Studio):** Designed and developed an Android app to receive data from the ESP32, display activity information, and trigger emergency alerts.  
- **Cloud Database (Firebase):** Implemented Firebase for real-time data storage, synchronization, and push notifications, ensuring secure and scalable communication between devices.  
- **Communication Layer:** Established wireless communication between the ESP32 and the mobile app for continuous monitoring.  
- **Experimental Validation:** Conducted simulations and controlled tests to validate the accuracy of fall detection algorithms.  
- **Emergency Alerts:** Integrated automated notifications to caregivers or emergency contacts when a fall was detected.  

**Impact:**  
This project demonstrates my ability to combine **electronics, embedded programming, mobile development, and cloud services** into a cohesive system with real-world applications. It highlights my skills in **IoT, control systems, and user-centered software design**, while addressing a socially relevant problem.  
  
-  **Automation & IoT Systems** ‚Äì Control and monitoring projects with sensors, actuators, and embedded systems.
